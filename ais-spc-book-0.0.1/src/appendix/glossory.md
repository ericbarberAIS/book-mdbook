#### Control Chart:
- A control chart is one of the primary techniques of statistical process control (SPC). The control chart is a graphical display of quality characteristics that have been measured or computed from a sample versus the sample number or time. The control chart was invented by Walter Shewhart at Bell Labs in 1920.

#### Statistical Process Control:
- Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a statistical method to measure, monitor, and control a process. In other words, SPC is a quality control method that employs statistical methods to measure, monitor, and control a process.

#### Common Cause:
- A cause of variation in the process is due to chance but not assignable to any factor. It is the variation that is inherent in the process. A process under the influence of a common cause will always be stable and predictable.

#### Assignable Cause (“Special Cause”):
- The variation in a process that is not due to chance can be identified and eliminated. A process under the influence of a special cause will not be stable and predictable.

#### Rational Sub-Grouping:
- Rational sub-grouping is the process of organizing the data into groups produced under the same conditions. Rational subgroups help in the estimation process of short-term variations. Thus, rational subgrouping is the basis for operating control charts in a successful manner. These variations later help us predict the long-term variations and their control limits, depending o the type of causes for the variation (special or common).
