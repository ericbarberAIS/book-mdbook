# The Origin of Statistical Process Control and Shewhart's Contribution

Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a cornerstone in the field of quality control and has played a pivotal role in the evolution of manufacturing processes. The development of SPC is intrinsically linked to the work of Walter A. Shewhart in the early 20th century.

## Early Developments in Quality Control

Before the 1920s, quality control in manufacturing primarily relied on post-production inspection. This method often resulted in inefficiencies, with high rates of defects and wastage.

## Shewhart at Bell Telephone Laboratories

Walter A. Shewhart worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories during the 1920s. His role in research and development required consistent quality and reliability, leading to his groundbreaking work in process control.

## Shewhart's Breakthrough: The Control Chart

In 1924, Shewhart developed the control chart, fundamentally changing how manufacturing processes were monitored:

- **Control Chart:** This tool allowed for real-time monitoring of manufacturing processes, helping to identify when a process was deviating due to external factors.
- **Statistical Control:** Shewhart introduced the concept of a process being in a state of statistical control, operating with inherent variability and free from external influences.

## Shewhart's 1931 Book

Shewhart's book, "Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product," was published in 1931. It laid the theoretical foundation for SPC and introduced the Shewhart Cycle, later evolved into the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle by W. Edwards Deming.

## Shewhart's Contributions

### Statistical Theory in Industrial Context

Shewhart was among the first to apply statistical methods practically in an industrial setting, revolutionizing quality control processes.

### Quality Management Philosophy

Shewhart's work transcended technical tools, influencing a broader philosophy of continuous improvement and the role of management in quality control.

### Legacy and Influence

His ideas were further developed by other quality management pioneers and continue to influence modern quality control and process improvement methodologies.

In summary, Walter A. Shewhart's contributions to quality control have been transformative, shifting industries towards a more proactive and statistically informed approach to quality management. His legacy endures in modern methodologies like Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma.
