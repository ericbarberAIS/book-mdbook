PySpark is well-suited for handling large datasets and performing complex data aggregations. Given your dataset with three detail columns and one metric column, you can create summaries for each value in the detail columns and for each combination of these values.

Here's a general approach to achieve this:

## Import Necessary Libraries: First, make sure to import the necessary PySpark libraries.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, avg, count
```
Initialize Spark Session: If you're in Databricks, a Spark session should already be initialized for you. Otherwise, you can create one.

```python

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataSummary").getOrCreate()
```
Load Your Dataset: Load your dataset into a DataFrame. Assuming you have a dataset in a compatible format (like CSV, Parquet, etc.).

```python
df = spark.read.csv("path_to_your_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
```

Aggregate Data: Perform aggregations for each detail column and for each combination of detail columns. Let's assume your detail columns are named detail1, detail2, detail3, and your metric column is metric.

## Summary for each value in individual detail columns:
```python

summary_detail1 = df.groupBy("detail1").agg(
    sum("metric").alias("sum_metric"),
    avg("metric").alias("avg_metric"),
    count("metric").alias("count_metric")
)

summary_detail2 = df.groupBy("detail2").agg(
    sum("metric").alias("sum_metric"),
    avg("metric").alias("avg_metric"),
    count("metric").alias("count_metric")
)

summary_detail3 = df.groupBy("detail3").agg(
    sum("metric").alias("sum_metric"),
    avg("metric").alias("avg_metric"),
    count("metric").alias("count_metric")
)
```
Summary for each combination of detail columns:

```python
summary_combination = df.groupBy("detail1", "detail2", "detail3").agg(
   sum("metric").alias("sum_metric"),
   avg("metric").alias("avg_metric"),
   count("metric").alias("count_metric")
)
```
Save or Display Results: You can display these summaries or save them for further analysis.

```python
summary_detail1.show()
summary_detail2.show()
summary_detail3.show()
summary_combination.show()
# Or save them
summary_detail1.write.format("your_preferred_format").save("your_path")
# Repeat for other summaries
```
Drill-Down Analysis: For drill-down analysis, you can filter the summarized data based on specific conditions or join these summaries with other relevant data.

Remember, the specific functions (sum, avg, count) and the format for saving/loading data can be adjusted based on your specific requirements and data schema. Also, ensure that your Spark configurations are adequately set to handle the size and complexity of your data.
