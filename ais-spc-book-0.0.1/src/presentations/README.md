# Control Charts

## Overview [>](#line-chart)
Control charts are a fundamental tool in Statistical Process Control (SPC), used to monitor, control, and improve process performance over time. Here are the key benefits of using control charts:
- **Process Stability and Variability Reduction:** Control charts enable the monitoring of process stability and the identification of unusual variations, aiding in efforts to reduce process variability and improve consistency.

- **Early Detection of Issues:** They facilitate the early detection of trends, shifts, and patterns, allowing for timely corrective actions before defects or quality issues arise.

- **Informed Decision-making:** By distinguishing between common cause and special cause variations, control charts provide a factual basis for decision-making, reducing the likelihood of unnecessary adjustments.

- **Cost Efficiency:** The identification and reduction of process variability lead to lower waste, reduced rework, and fewer defects, thereby decreasing operational costs and increasing efficiency.

- **Continuous Improvement and Compliance:** Control charts are instrumental in continuous improvement initiatives and compliance with quality standards, offering a visual tool for tracking performance, documenting process control efforts, and communicating with stakeholders.
